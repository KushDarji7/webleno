      Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed.
  <br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way
  of
  determining its presentation. <p>Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to
      appear </p> in a printed document.
