Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed.
<br> It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a way
of
determining its presentation. <p>Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to
    appear </p> in a printed document.

        Autumn<br> Also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons. Outside the tropics,
        autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September or March. Autumn is the season when the duration
        of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.

        Winter<br> The coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs between autumn and spring. The
        tilt of Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun.

    I added this image because I am a fan of Hirohiko Araki's famous manga JoJo's Bizzare Adventure. 
    The selected image is theprotagonist from part 3; Jotoro Kujo. Jotaro is canonically established as a tall (195 cm/6'5")
    , attractive, and well-built man, even as a teenager. He has dark hair that constantly blends with his hat,
        a strong jaw, bold eyebrows, and green eyes.
